Project name: BROOMSTICK STRONG :P by Angela Chang
Analyzes form on the three powerlifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift) in training, as well as counts repetitions performed and analyzes form for the squat. Draws some pretty cool gradients.
Also can be a judge for competitions.
Note: as far as athletic movements go, the powerlifts require little mobility.
However, some very inflexible people will be unable to get into proper position for squats and deadlifts and will not be recognized by the project.
